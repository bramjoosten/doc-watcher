# doc-watcher

A local watcher script that mirrors a Confluence Server (on-prem) tree to disk so it can be searched and queried by IDE's and local AI. Authenticates with a user-level Personal Access Token, downloads fast (in parallel with concurrency, and re-runs incrementally — only fetching pages whose `lastmodified` is newer than the last sync.

Node.js, TypeScript, run via `tsx`.

## Requirements

### Must-have

- **Fast (parallel downloads).** A space can hold thousands of pages. The fetcher runs requests in parallel with bounded concurrency — enough to keep the network pipe full, not enough to get rate-limited.
- **Keep in sync.** Cheap re-runs that only fetch what changed since the last sync (using each page's `lastmodified` timestamp, queried via CQL). Removes pages that have been deleted or moved out of scope. Two runs back-to-back should produce identical output.
- **Node.js only (no Python).** Many organisations keep their stack narrow. Ruling out Python up front means doc-watcher drops into any Node-based environment without adding a runtime.
- **Keep the source HTML alongside the markdown.** For each page we save both `<file>.html` (the raw Confluence storage-format response) and `<file>.md` (the readable conversion). The HTML is the durable source of truth; the markdown is a regeneratable view. Conversion runs through a deterministic script (cheerio + an in-house HTML→Markdown walker + a macro registry), never an LLM, so re-running the converter on the saved HTML always produces the same markdown. If a future converter improvement lands, the corpus can be re-derived without re-hitting Confluence.

### Nice-to-have

- **Write back to Confluence.** Local folder as source of truth, push edits back as page versions. Opens the door to git-versioned docs, AI-generated pages, and round-trip workflows. Not in the first version.
- **Conflict handling.** Once write-back exists, simultaneous Confluence/local edits become a real problem. Flag and defer.

## Architecture

### Stack

- **Node 22+** with **TypeScript**, run via `tsx` in dev (no build step).
- Built-in `fetch` (undici); a 15-line inline `pLimit` helper for bounded-concurrency parallel downloads.
- `cheerio` for parsing Confluence storage-format XHTML.
- In-house HTML→Markdown walker in `converter.ts` (no `turndown` — DOM-lib transitive deps kept tripping corp security scanners).
- `zod` for typed config validation; `yaml` for YAML parsing.
- Credentials live in `config.yaml` directly — no `.env` file, no env-var indirection.

**Minimize third-party dependencies.** Reach for the Node standard library first; a dep only earns its keep when the alternative would be hundreds of lines of nontrivial code (XHTML parsing, HTML→markdown conversion). **No native modules** — the tool has to install on locked-down corporate machines where the npm proxy MITMs TLS and prebuilt binaries fail to download. Pure JavaScript across the board. The CLI is a plain Node entry point using `process.argv` — no `commander` / `yargs` / etc. Logging is `console.log` / `console.error`. No test framework for now.

### State: plain JSON, not frontmatter

The `.md` files have **no YAML frontmatter** — they're plain prose, easier for grep, editors, and LLMs to consume. All structural metadata (Confluence ID, version, ancestors, last-modified, links, embeds) lives in `<state_dir>/index.json`, with one entry per page keyed by Confluence ID. The state file is the source of truth for change detection and link resolution; the on-disk tree is the human-facing view derived from it. Writes are atomic via `tmp` + `rename` — interrupted runs never leave a half-written state file.

State is **flushed after every successful page write** during a sync, not just at the end. So an interrupt (Ctrl+C, crash, network failure) leaves the state file reflecting exactly the pages already on disk. The next `npm start` re-queries the same CQL window (last_sync doesn't advance until the sync completes), diffs against the persisted per-page versions, and only fetches the pages not yet recorded. Resume is automatic — no `--resume` flag, no special verb.

JSON over SQLite is deliberate: doc-watcher is single-process and the whole state is small (a few hundred KB even for 10k pages), so the durability and concurrency advantages of an embedded DB don't pay back the cost of a native dependency that may not install on locked-down corporate machines.

**Source-URL header.** The first line of every converted `.md` is a markdown autolink to the Confluence source page, e.g. `<https://confluence.example.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12345>`. It renders as a clickable link in any markdown viewer, keeps the file traceable on its own, and is regenerated during `reconvert`. Beyond this single line the body is unadorned markdown.

### Output layout (`docs/` mirrors Confluence)

```
.state/
  index.json                              # state + structural metadata
docs/
  ENG/                                    # space key
    _index.html / _index.md               # space homepage
    onboarding--67890/                    # parent page → folder; ID after `--`
      _index.html / _index.md             #   the page itself; ID is in folder name
      setup-guide--99999.html             # leaf child — raw storage format
      setup-guide--99999.md               # leaf child — converted markdown
    attachments/<page_id>/diagram.png
```

**Filename rule.** Each page produces two files side-by-side: `<slug>--<id>.html` (raw Confluence storage format) and `<slug>--<id>.md` (derived markdown). Slug is the lowercase, kebab-cased, ASCII-folded page title. The `--<id>` suffix is the durable anchor — if the state file is ever lost, files can still be matched back to their Confluence pages by ID alone.

**Page titles can change**, so filenames can change between syncs. The watcher detects renames via the state entry (keyed by ID): when title changes, it does the local rename (file or folder) without re-fetching the body. A re-parent moves the file or folder under a new parent. History is preserved if the user's `docs/` is under git.

**Parent vs leaf.** A page with children becomes a folder `<slug>--<id>/` containing `_index.html` and `_index.md`. A leaf is two flat files. This mirrors the way most static-site tools think about hierarchy.

### Change detection

Confluence Server has no dedicated sync endpoint, but CQL on `/rest/api/content/search` is enough:

```
(space = "ENG" OR ancestor = 12345) AND type = page AND lastmodified >= "<last_sync_iso>"
```

For a 10k-page space the typical delta per 5-minute window is 0–50 pages — sub-second API time. `last_sync` in the state file is the lower bound; first run has none and does a full enumeration. Every subsequent run is delta-only.

**Deletes** aren't visible in the incremental query (they're just absent). The default `sync` runs a cheap id-only full enumeration once per day to reconcile orphans (gated by `sources.last_full_enum`). `refresh` always does a full enumeration.

### Confluence REST endpoints used

- `GET /rest/api/content/search?cql=...&limit=100&expand=version` — list pages, with paging.
- `GET /rest/api/content/{id}?expand=body.storage,version,ancestors,space` — full page (storage-format XHTML).
- `GET /rest/api/content/{id}/child/attachment?expand=version` — attachment list.
- `GET /download/attachments/{pageId}/{filename}` — binary download.

Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <pat from config.yaml>` on every request.

TLS certificate verification is disabled process-wide (`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`, set in `src/disable-tls-check.ts` which is imported first). Corporate Confluence instances often sit behind private CAs that Node doesn't trust out of the box; rather than asking every user to wrangle a PEM bundle, doc-watcher just skips cert verification. The deliberate scope: a single-user CLI talking to a Confluence on a network you already trust. The warning Node would otherwise print on every HTTPS connection is filtered out by patching `process.emitWarning`.

### Converter

Confluence "storage format" is XHTML with `<ac:structured-macro>` extensions. A pre-pass with cheerio rewrites macros to plain HTML, then an in-house walker emits markdown. A registry of macro handlers covers code blocks, callouts (info/warning/note), images and attachments, internal links, iframes/embeds, status badges, task lists, user mentions, and emoticons. Unknown macros become HTML comments — visible but inert. The walker handles the standard HTML tag set (p, h1–h6, ul/ol/li with nesting, strong/em/code, pre+code with language hint, a, img, blockquote with our callout data attribute, GFM tables, hr, br).

Always deterministic, always replayable. The `.html` file on disk is what the converter ran against; given the same HTML and the same converter version, you get the same `.md`.

### Core flows

**`npm start`** is the daily driver. With no args it runs `sync`: incremental if state exists, full enumeration if it doesn't (so the first invocation does the bulk download). It also triggers an autotune automatically if `parallel_downloads` is unset in `config.yaml`. Run it again whenever you want fresh docs — subsequent runs only fetch what changed.

Verbs:

- **`sync`** (default): autotune if needed → build CQL with `lastmodified` lower bound, page through results, diff against state, fetch changed pages in parallel, write both `.html` and `.md`, atomic state-file replace at the end.
- **`refresh`**: same as `sync` but ignores `last_sync` (full re-download).
- **`reconvert`**: walk every `.html` already on disk and regenerate the `.md` next to it. No network calls. Used after a converter change.

Setup is manual: copy `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml` and fill in the placeholders (`base_url`, `pat`, `watch[].root_page_id`). No `init` verb — fewer moving parts.

There is no explicit `bench` verb. The autotune is internal — triggered only when `parallel_downloads` is missing from `config.yaml`. To force a re-bench, comment out (or delete) the value in `config.yaml` and run `npm start` again.

### Concurrency autotune

The first run is the one that hurts. A space can hold thousands of pages, and the right tuning depends on the network, the server's load, the CPU, and what else is on the machine — there's no universal number that's right. Too low and the initial sync drags; too high and we either saturate the link or trip Confluence's rate limit.

So before the first real `sync`, doc-watcher runs a short empirical benchmark. It sweeps a small grid of concurrency values, measures elapsed time and error rate at each point, finds the peak zero-error level, then **steps one tier down** before writing the chosen value back into `config.yaml` under `sync`. The step-down matters: the bench probes ~30 pages, which measures *burst* tolerance, but a full sync sustains the load across thousands of pages and the server's token bucket only drains under sustained pressure. Picking the next tier below the peak trades a slice of throughput for a much lower chance of cascading 429s mid-run. The HTTP client also retries 429/503 with exponential backoff (up to 8 attempts, max 60 s per wait, `Retry-After` honoured) so transient throttling doesn't kill the run.

After that, every run just reads the value from `config.yaml`. The bench only runs again when **`parallel_downloads` is missing** (commented out or absent) — that's the sole trigger. Editing the value by hand pins it; the bench won't overwrite a hand-set value.

There's also a fallback heuristic (`min(50, max(4, cpu_cores * 2))`) for the awkward case where the bench is somehow skipped *and* no value exists in config — but in practice, missing-means-bench keeps this from triggering.

Re-bench when conditions change (slower link, server upgrade, etc.) by commenting out the value in `config.yaml` and running `npm start` again.

## Out of scope (for now)

- Webhooks. Confluence Server webhooks need admin-level configuration; we only have a user PAT. CQL polling is enough.
- Adapter abstractions for multiple sources (Notion, Confluence Cloud, etc.). Left as a one-source codebase until a second source actually exists.
- Write-back and conflict handling. See nice-to-haves above.
